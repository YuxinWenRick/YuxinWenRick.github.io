# About Me
I am a second-year Computer Science Ph.D. student at the University of Maryland, College Park, advised by [Prof. Tom Goldstein](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~tomg/). 

I am interested in computer vision and machine learning. My current research mainly focuses on security and privacy in machine learning.
