# About Me
I am a Ph.D. student in Department of Computer Science at University of Maryland, College Park, advised by [Prof. Tom Goldstein](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~tomg/). 
Before that, I received Bachelors of Science in Computer Science and Mathematics at University of Maryland, College Park with Magna Cum Laude in May 2021.

I am interested in computer vision and machine learning.
